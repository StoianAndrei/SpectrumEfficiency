I started a company some years ago, intending to act as a conduit between entities that work together in a symbiosis relationship. In my opinion, these four entities are:

* the public
* the business
* professionals
* the regulator/government.


I have had prior exposure and training with Radio Spectrum Management in my first job in New Zealand working for Spark. It is here that I saw this gap that I wanted to address. Only when I joined Radio Spectrum Management I quickly realized how deep the rabbit hole goes and that I have only scratched the surface. So many other radio-licenced services are crucial to effectively allowing New Zealanders access to the radio spectrum. We find details of these services in the Public Information Brochure [PIB 38](https://www.rsm.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/documents/pibs/3eadde74f8/radio-licence-certification-rules-pib-38.pdf)
