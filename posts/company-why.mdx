I started a company some years ago intending to act as a conduit between entities that work together in a symbiosis relation. In my opinion, these four entities are:

* the public
* the business
* professionals
* the regulator/government.


Thus Spectrum Efficiency was incorporated, the name stands for:

> How efficient are you in delivering a specific communication given that you only have a certain amount of time to do it.
